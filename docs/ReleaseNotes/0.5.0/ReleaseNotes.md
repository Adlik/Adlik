Release Date: 2022-6-21
Compatibility: The functional interfaces of Adlik r0.5 are compatible with previous release.

## Feature List

### Model Optimizer

- Support quantization and distillation of YOLOv5s models, which achieves nearly 2.5 times inference performance
improvement with OpenVINO runtime.

### Model Zoo

- A new repository that stores Adlik optimized and compiled models, including ResNet series models and YOLOv5 series models.

### Compiler

- Support compilation path from oneflow to onnx
- OpenVINO upgraded to version 2022.1.0

### Inference Engine

- Support Torch runtime
- OpenVINO upgraded to version 2022.1.0

### Benchmark Test

- Benchmark test for BERT model on Intel 8260 CPU, including throughput and other performance indicators.
