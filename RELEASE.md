# Release Management

The management by which Adlik versions are officially released is described in this document.

## Versioning

Adlik project releases follow the specification of Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 with the following caveats:

1. Undocumented APIs, features marked EXPERIMENTAL or DEPRECATED may change at any time (though we aim for stability).
2. If you want more stability for a particular feature, contribute a unit test.

## Release criteria

1. Reported bugs should not have any critical issues.
2. All bugs, new features, enhancements must be tested. (At least the coverage of test code should not decrease.)
3. All documents need to be reviewed with no broken link.
4. Performance testing results should be evaluated by Adlik test module.

## Release process

Adlik is released 4 times per year, typically 1 time in 3 months.
